Create a `secrets.h` file in the `src/` directory:

* link:https://hub.docker.com/_/telegraf[Telegraf]
* link:https://hub.docker.com/_/influxdb[InfluxDb]

I found link:https://www.reddit.com/r/unRAID/comments/7c2l2w/howto_monitor_unraid_with_grafana_influxdb_and/[this Reddit tutorial] invaluable for configuration.

Use the link:./telegraf.conf[telegraf.conf] file as the Telegraf config.
You will need to swap out the configuration variables (marked as `+{{NAME}}+`) in the file for their respective strings.
